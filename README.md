# Immersive Web Early Adopters Guide

This material is draft documentation intended for use by those experimenting with the WebXR Device API and related specs. It is modeled after the API documentation in MDN web docs. Because the spec it applies to is still under development, it does NOT go as deep as its MDN cousin. The work here is mostly confined to interface descriptions. The only exceptions are where more depth is deemed necessary than is provided by the interface page.

This material is intended to be temporary. As soon as WebXR generally available in a stable version of a browser, the material here will be copied to MDN and this repository will be deprecated.

We welcome feedback and pull requests.

## Spec-Related Updates

The web and web specs are always evolving. New specs like the Immersive web
can undergo changes that would never be made to a mature production-ready spec.

**This documentation set is always updated to reflect spec changes. To be
notified of those updates [watch this repo](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-reference)
on GitHub.**

The following table shows changes that may require corrections to your code.
